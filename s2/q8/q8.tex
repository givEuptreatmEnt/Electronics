\section{8.3}

The NMOS transistor in the discrete CS amplifier circuit of Fig
is biased to have $g_m = \SI{1}{\mA/\V}$. Find
$A_M, f_{P1}, f_{P2}, f_{P3}, f_L$.

\Ans \\

$R_{\text{sig}} = \SI{100}{\kohm},
R_G = \SI{47}{\Mohm} \paral \SI{10}{\Mohm}
\approx \SI{8.25}{\Mohm}, R_D = \SI{4.7}{\kohm}, R_L = \SI{10}{\kohm},
g_m = \SI{1}{\mA/\V}$,
\[ A_M = \frac{R_G}{R_{\text{sig}} + R_G}g_m(R_D \paral R_L)
\approx 3.16 (\si{\V/\V}). \]

$C_1 = \SI{0.01}{\micro\F}, C_S = \SI{10}{\micro\F}, C_2 = \SI{0.1}{\micro\F}$,
let $r_m = 1/g_m = \SI{1}{\kohm}, R_S = \SI{2}{\kohm}$,
\begin{alignat*}{3}
  f_{P1} &= \frac{1}{2\pi C_1(R_{\text{sig}}+R_G)} &&\approx \SI{1.9}{\Hz}, \\
  f_{P2} &= \frac{1}{2\pi C_S(r_m \paral R_S)} &&\approx \SI{23.9}{\Hz}, \\
  f_{P3} &= \frac{1}{2\pi C_1(R_{\text{sig}}+R_G)} &&\approx \SI{108.3}{\Hz}.
\end{alignat*}
So $f_L = f_{P3} = \SI{108.3}{\Hz}$.

\section{8.16}
Starting from the expression for the MOSTFET unity-gain frequency,
\[ f_T = \frac{g_m}{2\pi (C_{gs}+C_{gd})} \]
and making the approximation that $C_{gs} \gg C_{gd}$ and that the
overlap component of $C_{gs}$ is negligibly small, show that for an
n-channel device
\[ f_T \approx \frac{3\mu_nV_{OV}}{4\pi L^2} \]
Observe that for a given channel length, $f_T$ can be increased by
operating the MOSFET at a higher overdrive voltage. Evaluate $f_T$ for
devices with $L = \SI{1.0}{\um}$ operated at overdrive voltages of
\SI{0.25}{\V} and \SI{0.5}{\V}. Use $\mu_n = \SI{450}{\cm^2/\V}$s.

\Ans \\
\[ f_T = \frac{g_m}{2\pi (C_{gs}+C_{gd})} \]
Now let $C_{gs} \gg C_{gd}$, we know $g_m = k_nV_{OV} = \mu_nC_{ox}(W/L)$ and
$C_{gs} = \frac{2}{3}WLC_{ox}$, so
\[ f_T \approx \frac{\mu_n C_{ox}(W/L)V_{OV}}{2\pi \frac{2}{3}WLC_{ox}}
= \frac{3\mu_nV_{OV}}{4\pi L^2} \]
$f_T$ will increase as $V_{OV}$ inscreases.

Now $L = \SI{1}{\um}, \mu_n = \SI{450}{\cm^2/\V}$, we can evaluate $f_T$:
\begin{alignat*}{2}
  V_{OV} &= \SI{0.25}{\V} & \qRq f_T &\approx \SI{2.7}{\GHz} \\
  V_{OV} &= \SI{0.5}{\V} & \qRq f_T &\approx \SI{5.4}{\GHz}
\end{alignat*}

\section{8.30}
The analysis of the high-frequency response of the common-source amplifier,
presented in the text, is based on the assumption that the resistance of
the signal source, $R_{\text{sig}}$, is large and, thus, that its interaction
with the input capacitance $C_{\text{in}}$ produces the ``dominat pole''
that determines the upper 3-dB frequency $f_H$. In some situations, however,
the CS amplifier is fed with a very low $R_{\text{sig}}$. To investigate the
high-frequency response of the amplifier in such a case, Fig shows the
equivalent circuit when the CS amplifier is fed with an ideal voltage source
$V_{\text{sig}}$ having $R_{\text{sig}} = 0$. Note that $C_L$ denotes the
total capacitance at the output node. By writing a node equation at the
output, show that the transfer function $V_o/V_{\text{sig}}$ is given by
\[ \frac{V_o}{V_{\text{sig}}} =
-g_mR_L' \frac{1-s(C_{gd}/g_m)}{1+s(C_L+C_{gd})R_L'} \]
At frequencies $\omega \ll (g_m/C_{gd})$, the $s$ term in the numerator
can be neglected. In such case, what is the upper 3-dB frequency resulting?
Compute the values of $A_M$ and $f_H$ for the case:
$C_{gd} = \SI{0.5}{\pF}, C_L = \SI{2}{\pF}, g_m = \SI{4}{\mA/\V}$, and
$R_L' = \SI{5}{\kohm}$.

\Ans \\
Use node analysis, we have
\[
  V_o \left(sC_{gd} + \frac{1}{R_L'} + sC_L\right)
  = V_{\text{sig}} \left(sC_{gd} - g_m\right),
\]
so
\[ \frac{V_o}{V_{\text{sig}}} =
-g_mR_L' \frac{1-s(C_{gd}/g_m)}{1+s(C_L+C_{gd})R_L'}.
\]
as desired.

If $\omega \ll (g_m/C_{gd})$, we have
\[ \frac{V_o}{V_{\text{sig}}} \approx
-g_mR_L' \frac{1}{1+s(C_L+C_{gd})R_L'}.
\]
So $\omega_H = 1/(C_L+C_{gd})R_L'$, the 3-dB frequency $f_H = \omega_H / 2\pi$.

For $C_{gd} = \SI{0.5}{\pF}, C_L = \SI{2}{\pF}, g_m = \SI{4}{\mA/\V}$, and
$R_L' = \SI{5}{\kohm}$.
\begin{gather*}
  A_{M} = -g_mR_L' = -20 (\si{\V/\V}), \\
  f_H = \frac{1}{2\pi (C_L+C_{gd})R_L'} = \SI{12.7}{\MHz}.
\end{gather*}

\section{8.34}
For a version of the CE amplifier circuit in Fig,
$R_{\text{sig}} = \SI{10}{\kohm}, R_1 = \SI{68}{\kohm}, R_2 = \SI{27}{\kohm},
R_E = \SI{2.2}{\kohm}, R_C = \SI{4.7}{\kohm}, R_L = \SI{10}{\kohm}.$
The collector current is $\SI{0.8}{\mA}, \beta = 200, f_T = \SI{1}{\GHz},
C_{\mu} = \SI{0.8}{\pF}$. Neglecting the effect of $r_x$ and $r_o$,
find the midband voltage gain and the upper 3-dB frequency $f_H$.

\Ans \\
First we calculate $g_m = I_C / V_T = \SI{32}{\mA/\V}$, so
$r_{\pi} = \beta/g_m = \SI{6.25}{\kohm},
r_e = \alpha/g_m \approx \SI{31.1}{\ohm}$.
Let $R_B = R_1 \paral R_2 = \SI{19.33}{\kohm}$, then
\[
  A_M = -\frac{R_B \paral r_{\pi}}{R_{\text{sig}}+(R_B\paral r_{\pi})}
  \frac{R_C \paral R_L}{r_e}
  \approx -32.8 (\si{\V/\V}).
\]
Now we know that
\[ f_H = \frac{\omega_H}{2\pi}
= \frac{1}{2\pi C_{\text{in}}R_{\text{sig}}'} \]
where
\begin{gather*}
  C_{\text{in}} = C_{\pi} + C_{\mu}(1+g_mR_L') \\
  R_{\text{sig}}' = R_{\text{sig}} \paral R_B \paral r_{\pi} \\
  R_{L}' = R_C \paral R_L
\end{gather*}
and $C_{\pi} + C_{\mu} = g_m/2\pi f_T$, now use the values given we can get
\[ f_H \approx \SI{571}{\kHz}. \]

\section{8.48}
A common-source MOS amplifier, whose equivalent circuit resembles that
in Fig, is to be evaluated for its high-frequency response. For this
particular design, $R_{\text{sig}} = \SI{1}{\Mohm}, R_G = \SI{5}{\Mohm},
R_L' = \SI{100}{\kohm}, C_{gs} = \SI{0.2}{\pF}, C_{gd} = \SI{0.1}{\pF},
g_m = \SI{0.3}{\mA/\V}$. Estimate the midband gain and the 3-dB frequency.

\section{8.63}
It is required to analyze the high-frequency response of the CMOS amplifier
shown in Fig. The dc bias current is \SI{100}{\uA}.
For $Q_1$, $\mu_nC_{ox} = \SI{90}{\uA/\V^2}, V_A = \SI{12.8}{\V},
W/L = \SI{100}{\um}/\SI{1.6}{\um}, C_{gs} = \SI{0.2}{\pF},
C_{gd} = \SI{0.015}{\pF}, C_{db} = \SI{20}{\fF}$. For $Q_2$,
$C_{gd} = \SI{0.015}{\pF}$, $C_{db} = \SI{36}{\fF}, \abs{V_A} = \SI{19.2}{\V}$.
Assume that the resistance of the input signal generator is negligibly small.
Also, for simplicity, assume that the signal voltage at the gate of $Q_2$
is zero. Find the low-frequency gain, the frequency of the pole, and the
frequency of the zero.
\section{8.67}
Consider a CS amplifier loaded in a current source with an output resistance
equal to $r_o$ of the amplifying transistor. the amplifier is fed from a
signal source with $R_{\text{sig}} = r_o/2$. The transistor is biased to
operate at $g_m = \SI{2}{\mA/\V}$ and $r_o = \SI{20}{\kohm}$;
$C_{gs} = C_{gd} = \SI{0.1}{\pF}$. Use the Miller approximation to
determine an estimate of $f_H$. Repeat for the follwing two cases:
\begin{enumerate*}[(i)]
  \item the bias current $I$ in the entire system is reduced by a factor of
    $4$, and
  \item the bias current $I$ in the entire system is increased by a factor of
    $4$.
\end{enumerate*}
Remember that both $R_{\text{sig}}$ and $R_L$ will change as $r_o$ changes.

\section{8.72}
Find the dc gain and the 3-dB frequency of a MOS cascode amplifier operated
at $g_m = \SI{1}{\mA/\V}$ and $r_o = \SI{50}{\kohm}$. The MOSFETs have
$C_{gs} = \SI{30}{\fF}, C_{gd} = \SI{10}{\fF}, C_{db} = \SI{10}{\fF}$.
The amplifier is fed from a signal source with
$R_{\text{sig}} = \SI{100}{\kohm}$ and is connected to a load resistance of
\SI{2}{\Mohm}. There is also a load capacitance $C_L$ of \SI{40}{\fF}.
\section{8.79}
Refer to Fig. In situations in which $R_{\text{sig}}$ is large, the
high-frequency response of the source follower is determined by the low-pass
circuit formed by $R_{\text{sig}}$ and the input capacitance. An estimate
of $C_{\text{in}}$ can be obtained by using the Miller approximation to
replace $C_{gs}$ with an input capacitance $C_{eq} = C_{gs}(1-K)$ where $K$
is the gain from gate to source. Using the low-frequency value of
$K = g_mR_L'/(1+g_mR_L')$ find $C_{eq}$ and hence $C_{\text{in}}$ and an
estimate of $f_H$. Is this estimate higher or lower than that obtained by the
method of open-circuit time constants?

\section{8.88}
Consider the active-loaded CMOS differential amplifier of Fig for
the case of all transistors operated at the same $\abs{V_{OV}}$ and having
the same $\abs{V_A}$. Also let the total capacitance at the output node
$(C_L)$ be four times the total capacitance at the input node of the
current mirror $C_m$, and show that the unity-gain frequency of $A_d$ is
$g_m/2\pi C_L$. For $V_A=\SI{20}{\V}, V_{OV}=\SI{0.2}{\V}, I=\SI{0.2}{\mA},
C_L=\SI{100}{\fF},C_m=\SI{25}{\fF}$, find the dc value of $A_d$, and the
value of $f_{P1}, f_t, f_{P2}, f_Z$ and sketch a Bode plot for $\abs{A_d}$.
